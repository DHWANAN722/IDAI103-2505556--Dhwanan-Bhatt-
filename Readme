🎨 ArtRestorer AI
A Generative AI–Powered Smart Assistant for Art Restoration Support
📌 Project Overview

ArtRestorer AI is a generative AI–powered web application designed to support the digital restoration and interpretation of damaged, faded, or partially lost artworks. The application assists museum curators, art historians, conservators, and students by generating intelligent, culturally sensitive restoration suggestions using descriptive textual inputs. Instead of relying on image uploads, the system works entirely through structured text descriptions, making it lightweight, accessible, and adaptable across diverse heritage contexts.

The core objective of ArtRestorer AI is to bridge the gap between traditional art restoration expertise and modern artificial intelligence. By leveraging advanced generative language models, the system helps infer missing artistic elements, stylistic continuity, symbolic meaning, and historical context while respecting the original cultural and artistic integrity of the artwork.

🎯 Problem Definition and Motivation

Cultural heritage institutions around the world face increasing challenges in preserving aging artworks. Many pieces suffer from fading pigments, water damage, erosion, missing sections, or incomplete documentation. Traditional restoration requires extensive expertise, time, and historical research, which may not always be readily available.

ArtRestorer AI addresses this problem by providing AI-assisted restoration guidance based on:

Artistic style and historical period

Material and medium characteristics

Descriptions of damage or deterioration

Cultural and symbolic context

The system does not replace human restorers, but instead acts as a smart decision-support tool that accelerates research, inspires plausible restoration approaches, and improves accessibility to heritage knowledge.

🔬 Research Background

The project draws inspiration from both traditional art restoration practices and modern AI-assisted cultural heritage research. Conventional restorers rely heavily on stylistic inference, symmetry, material continuity, and historical references to reconstruct missing elements. Recent studies show that generative AI models can simulate these reasoning processes by learning patterns in language, style, and historical descriptions.

Key research insights that influenced this project include:

Restoration is most effective when grounded in period-specific styles and materials

Over-restoration can harm authenticity, so AI outputs must remain suggestive, not definitive

Text-based generative AI can successfully emulate visual reasoning when prompts are detailed and well-structured

Cultural sensitivity is essential when interpreting religious, symbolic, or indigenous artworks

These findings shaped the decision to use descriptive prompt-based generation rather than automated image reconstruction.

🤖 Model Selection and Configuration

ArtRestorer AI uses Gemini 1.5 Pro, a large multimodal generative AI model capable of deep contextual understanding, reasoning, and creative generation.

Model Integration

API integrated using the google-generativeai Python library

Connected to a Python-based Streamlit web application

Accepts structured user input via text fields

Key Input Parameters

Artwork type (painting, sculpture, textile, manuscript)

Artistic period or style (Renaissance, Mughal, Gothic, etc.)

Artist name (if known)

Damage description

Desired output type (restoration suggestion, narrative, symbol interpretation)

Hyperparameter Tuning

Temperature:

0.3–0.4 → conservative, historically accurate suggestions

0.7–0.9 → creative, stylistic interpretations

Controlled randomness ensures outputs remain plausible and culturally respectful

🧠 Prompt Engineering Strategy

Prompt engineering is a core strength of ArtRestorer AI. Prompts are carefully designed to combine user input, artistic context, and explicit instructions to guide the model’s reasoning.

Example Prompt Features

Style-aware reconstruction

Region-specific cultural references

Medium-sensitive restoration logic

Damage-type analysis

Narrative and educational explanations

Sample Prompts Used

Restore a Renaissance oil painting with faded corner using period-appropriate lighting

Generate Mughal miniature border patterns with floral symmetry

Suggest facial reconstruction for an eroded 12th-century sandstone sculpture

Recreate missing calligraphy in a medieval manuscript

Propose textile repair ideas for an 18th-century silk tapestry

Interpret symbolic motifs in religious wall paintings

Generate museum-friendly summaries for visitors

Describe color palette restoration after water damage

Suggest ethical restoration boundaries

Translate historical inscriptions into simplified narratives

Each prompt was iteratively refined to improve clarity, accuracy, and output relevance.

📊 Output Evaluation and Validation

Generated outputs were evaluated based on:

Stylistic consistency with known art movements

Cultural and historical accuracy

Logical coherence and clarity

Practical usefulness for restoration planning

Multiple simulations were run across different art forms and periods. Prompts producing vague or overly imaginative outputs were revised, and temperature settings were adjusted to improve precision.

The results demonstrated that ArtRestorer AI consistently produces context-aware, informative, and ethically cautious restoration guidance, making it suitable for educational and professional use.
